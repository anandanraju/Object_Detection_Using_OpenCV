# Object_Detection_Using_OpenCV
Object Detection is a technology of deep learning, where things, human, building, cars can be detected as object in image and videos.It is merely to recognize the object with bounding box in the image, where in image classification, we can simply categorize(classify) that is an object in the image or not in terms of the likelihood.
